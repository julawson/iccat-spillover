```{r analaysis, volumes}
#Question. Does the total catch (Qty_t) of stocks that never receive a TAC (tacever==0) change within vessels that catch at least one TAC-regulated stock (tac_any==1)?
#Answer. The sign is positive, suggesting that the total catch of stocks that never receive a TAC increases within vessels that catch at least one TAC-managed stock. However, the difference is not statistically significant, suggesting that the change in total volumes caught is minimal.

stockvolreg <- feols(Qty_t ~ tac_any | FleetGear + YearC^SpeciesStock, data = filter(iccat_df_final_edit, tacever==0))

#By understanding that total volumes caught are relatively stable over time, we can next investigate if proportions within that total volume are changing.

```

```{r analaysis, proportions}
#Question. Does the proportion of the catch (propStock) of stocks that never receive a TAC (tac_ever==0) change within vessels that catch at least one TAC_regulated stock (tac_any==1)?
#Answer. The difference is statistically significant and negative (-0.04), suggesting that the proportion of non-TAC stocks decreases within FleetGears that catch at least one TAC managed stock.

#Our hypothesis is that the proportion of non-TAC stocks would increase among vessels that catch at least one TAC-managed stock. This result is the opposite of what we expected.

```

```{r analaysis by fleet}
#Question. Does the proportion of the catch of non-TAC stocks in fleets that are catching one or more TAC stock increase or decrease relative to the catch of non-TAC stocks in fleets that do not catch any TAC stocks?
#Answer. The treatment (being a fleet that catches one or more TAC stock) catch of non-TAC stocks in fleets that are catching one or more TAC stock increase

#Regression 1. ----
#Question: Does the catch of non-TAC stocks in fleets that are catching one or more TAC stock increase or decrease relative to the catch of non-TAC stocks in fleets that do not catch any TAC stocks?
#Answer from the regression output: Fleets that catch one or more TAC stock increase their catch by 10.89 metric tons, relative to fleets that do not catch any TAC stocks.

# tac_reg1 <- lm(Qty_t ~ tac_any + as.factor(YearC) + FleetGear + SpeciesStock, data = filter(iccat_df_final_edit, tacr==0))
# summary(tac_reg1) #matches feols output
#mb, 5.3.21: commenting out for speed, made YearC into a categorical FE

tac_reg1b <- feols(Qty_t ~ tac_any | YearC + FleetGear + SpeciesStock, data = filter(iccat_df_final_edit, tacr==0))
coef_tab <- tac_reg1b$coeftable
#This regression assumes that all stocks change in the same way over time (this is the YearC fixed effect on its own)

tac_reg1c <- feols(Qty_t ~ tac_any | YearC^SpeciesStock + FleetGear, data = filter(iccat_df_final_edit, tacr==0)) #mb: adding year-by-speciesstock FEs
coef_tab <- tac_reg1c$coeftable
#result: positive, significant spillover when adding FEs that account for variations in stock-by-year
#JML: Answer from regression output: The total catch of non-TAC regulated stocks (SpeciesStock) increases by 113.40 metric tons for fleets (FleetGear) that catch at least one TAC managed stock (tac_any = 1), when SpeciesStock is interacted with year (when we allow for each stock to individually vary over time). 

#Regression 2. ----
#Creating a column that is proportion of TAC-treated stocks in total catch (prop_tacC).
#iccat_df_final_test2 <- iccat_df_final_edit %>% 
#  group_by(YearC, FleetGear) %>% 
#  mutate(totalCatch = sum(Qty_t),
#         tac_catch = sum(Qty_t[tacr==1])) %>% #Total catch grouped by FleetGear and YearC
#  mutate(prop_tacC = tac_catch/totalCatch) #mb: notice this is different

#hist(iccat_df_final_test2$prop_tacC)
#JML: commented out Mark's code (above) to try new code (below)

#Creating a column that is the proportion of TAC-treated stocks in total catch in years prior to when the TAC went into effect (prop_tacCpre)
#Proportion of TAC catch averaged over five years before the TAC went into effect for each stock
iccat_df_final_reg <- iccat_df_final_edit %>% 
  filter(scaled_tacr >=-5 & scaled_tacr <=0) %>% 
  group_by(SpeciesStock,scaled_tacr) %>% 
  summarize(meanPropStock5yr = mean(propStock)) 

#Question. Does the proportion of TAC-treated stocks in a given fleet's total catch increase or decrease relative to the proportion of non-TAC treated stocks following TAC implementation?
#Answer from the regression:  The proportion of stocks that would be subject to TAC restrictions (tacever=1, tacr=0) in a given fleet's total catch, were 316X higher in the years prior to TAC implementation (tacr=0) compared to the years after TAC restrictions were in place.

# tac_reg2 <- lm(Qty_t ~ tac_any*prop_tacC + as.factor(YearC) + FleetGear + SpeciesStock, data = filter(iccat_df_final_reg, tacr==0))
# summary(tac_reg2)
# 
# tac_reg2b <- feols(Qty_t ~ tac_any*prop_tacC | YearC + FleetGear + SpeciesStock, data = filter(iccat_df_final_reg, tacr==0))
# # print(tac_reg2b)

tac_reg2c <- feols(Qty_t ~ prop_pretac_catch | YearC^SpeciesStock + FleetGear, data = filter(iccat_df_final_reg, tacr==0))
coef_tab <- tac_reg2c$coeftable

#note: this isn't strictly right, because we probably want the dosage based on the pre-treatment period only
